💳 Credit Card Data Science Project

A Data Science and Machine Learning project that analyzes credit card data to uncover patterns, build predictive models, and generate actionable insights. This project demonstrates how financial data can be used for fraud detection, customer segmentation, and credit risk assessment.

🚀 Features

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Understand transaction patterns, customer behavior, and spending categories

🧹 Data Preprocessing – Handle missing values, normalize features, and encode categorical variables

🧠 Machine Learning Models – Train models for fraud detection, segmentation, or risk prediction

📈 Evaluation Metrics – Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC (classification) or Silhouette Score (clustering)

🔍 Visualization – Graphs and charts to identify trends and anomalies

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python – Core language

Pandas, NumPy – Data preprocessing and analysis

Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization

Scikit-learn – Machine learning models and evaluation

Jupyter Notebook – Development and experimentation environment

⚙️ Workflow

Load Dataset – Credit card transactions or customer profiles

Data Preprocessing – Clean and transform raw data

EDA – Explore distributions, correlations, and anomalies

Modeling – Apply ML algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, K-Means, etc.)

Evaluation – Measure performance with appropriate metrics

Insights – Interpret results for fraud detection, segmentation, or risk analysis

🎯 Applications

Fraud detection systems for safe transactions

Customer segmentation for personalized marketing

Credit risk prediction for financial institutions
